# 🐶🐱 Cats vs Dogs Classification

This project is a deep learning-based **image classification model** that distinguishes between **cats** and **dogs**.  
It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and accurate classification.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies images into **Cats** or **Dogs**
- Built using **Deep Learning (CNNs)**
- Supports **TensorFlow/Keras** (can be adapted to PyTorch)
- Data preprocessing with OpenCV & NumPy
- Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn
